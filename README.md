# Virtual-Reality-Project
This project aims to revolutionize the treatment of alcohol addiction through the innovative use of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. By creating an immersive and interactive platform, the project addresses the limitations of traditional addiction treatment methods, such as low engagement and lack of personalization.
